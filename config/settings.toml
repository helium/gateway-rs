## gateway-rs configuration file

## Keypair is a string that supports specifying different locations for 
## the secrets. The default one is file based one since all devices 
## can support it.

# File based:

# Ecc608 based:
# keypair = "ecc://i2c-1:96?slot=0"
# onboarding = "ecc://i2c-1:96?slot=15"

# The local port to serve the local grpc on. 
# Do NOT expose this port outside of the host network for security
api = 4467

# The default region to use until a region is received from the Helium network.
# This value should line up with the configured region of the semtech packet
# forwarder. Note: Not setting this here or with a GW_REGION env var will stop
# packet and poc beaconing until the correct asserted region is retrieved.

# region = "US915"
